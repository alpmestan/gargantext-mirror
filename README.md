# Gargantext Haskell

## About this project

Gargantext is a collaborative web platform for the exploration of sets
of unstructured documents. It combines tools from natural language
processing, text-mining, complex networks analysis and interactive data
visualization to pave the way toward new kinds of interactions with your
digital corpora.

This software is a free software, developed by the CNRS Complex Systems
Institute of Paris ÃŽle-de-France (ISC-PIF) and its partners.

## Installation

### Front-End

Front-End is written in [Purescript](http://www.purescript.org/).
Then Gargantext Front-End is developed in another git repository. 
Before building the whole repo you need:

1. Get the source code:
    git clone https://gitlab.iscpif.fr/gargantext/purescript-gargantext.git
2. cd purescript-gargantext
3. read the README.md to install it


### Back-End

Back-End of Gargantext rely on several backends:
1. Haskell backend with orchestrator
2. Python backend
3. Others backends

Docker will be created to ease the backends installation.

## Haskell Backend

On Linux Debian (and Ubuntu?), install Dependencies.
sudo apt-get install libbz2-dev lipq-dev
(In the near future, we will use Nix.)
