Token and occurrence

An occurrence is not necessarily a token. Considering the sentence:
"A rose is a rose is a rose". We may equally correctly state that there
are eight or three words in the sentence. There are, in fact, three word
types in the sentence: "rose", "is" and "a". There are eight word tokens
in a token copy of the line. The line itself is a type. There are not
eight word types in the line. It contains (as stated) only the three
word types, 'a', 'is' and 'rose', each of which is unique. So what do we
call what there are eight of? They are occurrences of words. There are
three occurrences of the word type 'a', two of 'is' and three of 'rose'.
